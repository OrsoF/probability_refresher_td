\begin{Exercise}
     Let $\Omega=\left\{\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}, \omega_{4}\right\}$ equipped with the uniform probability distribution $\mathbb{P}$. Define the events $A=\left\{\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}\right\}, B=\left\{\omega_{1}, \omega_{3}\right\}$ and $C=\left\{\omega_{2}, \omega_{3}\right\}$. Show that $A, B$ and $C$ are pairwise independent. Compare $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B \cap C)$ and $\mathbb{P}(A) \mathbb{P}(B) \mathbb{P}(C)$.

\begin{Exercise}
Consider a family with two kids and the four equiprobable configurations $\left(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}\right)$ with $\omega_{i}=$ sex of $i$ th child.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the probability that both kids are girls, given that the younger one is a girl?

  \item What is the probability that both kids are girls, given that the older one is a girl?

  \item What is the probability that both kids are girls, given that the one of the two kids is a girl?

\end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}
    

Let $\left(C_{i}\right)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ be a partition of $\Omega$, that is, $\left(C_{i}\right)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ is a family of pairwise disjoint sets and $\bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq n} C_{i}=\Omega$. Let $A$ and $B$ be two events of $\Omega$. Suppose that

\begin{itemize}
  \item $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given any set $C_{i}$, that is,
\end{itemize}

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B \mid C_{i}\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(A \mid C_{i}\right) \mathbb{P}\left(B \mid C_{i}\right), \quad \text { for } i=1, \ldots, n .
$$

\begin{itemize}
  \item $B$ is independent of $C_{i}$ for any $1 \leq i \leq n$.
\end{itemize}

Show that $A$ and $B$ are independent.
