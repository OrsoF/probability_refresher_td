\begin{Exercise}
  Let $(X, Y)$ be a couple of random variables admitting a density on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that

  (i) $X$ has Gamma distribution $\gamma(2, \lambda)$ (with density $f_{X}(x)=\lambda^{2} x \mathrm{e}^{-\lambda x} \mathbb{1}_{\{x \geq 0\}}$ ),

  (ii) the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is the uniform distribution on the segment $[0, X]$ (or, to put it differently, the conditional density of $Y$ given $X=x$ is $f_{Y \mid X=x}(y)=$ $\left.\frac{1}{x} \mathbb{1}_{\{0<y<x\}}\right)$.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the density of $(X, Y)$ and the distribution of $Y$.

    \item Compute the conditional density of $X$ given $Y$.

    \item Evaluate the following quantities:

  \end{enumerate}

  (a) $\mathbb{E}[X Y]$ (one may use that $\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right]=\frac{6}{\lambda^{2}}$ ),

  (b) $\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X]$,

  (c) $\mathbb{E}[X \mid Y]$,

  (d) $\mathbb{E}[X+X Y \mid Y]$,

  (e) $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X]]$

\begin{Exercise}
  We consider an electronic device. Denote by $T$ the life time of the component, which is the amount of time in years such that it works properly until it breaks down. We assume that $T$ is exponentially distributed with parameter $1 / 2$.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the probability that the device breaks down during the first year?

    \item We know that the electronic device has been used during two years without any problems. What is the probability that it breaks down during the third year?

  \end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}
  We set

  $$
    f(x, y)=\frac{\alpha y^{2}}{x} \mathbf{1}_{0<y<x<1} .
  $$

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find $\alpha$ such that $f$ is a probability density on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of some pair of random variables $(X, Y)$ and compute the marginal laws of $X$ and $Y$.

    \item Prove that the conditional density of $Y$ given $X=x$ is given by

  \end{enumerate}

  $$
    f_{Y \mid X=x}(y)=\frac{3 y^{2}}{x^{3}}, 0<y<x<1
  $$

  and deduce that $\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X]=\frac{3}{4} X$.
